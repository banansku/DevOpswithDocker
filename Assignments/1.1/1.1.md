Since we already did "Hello, World!" in the material let's do something else.

Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit (such as nginx) in detached mode.

Stop two of the containers and leave one container running.

Submit the output for `docker ps -a` which shows 2 stopped containers and one running.

$ docker ps -a
