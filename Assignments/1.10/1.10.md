In this exercise, we won't create a new Dockerfile.

The image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` will start a web service in port `8080` when given the argument "server". In [Exercise 1.8](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-3#exercises-17---18) you already did an image that can be used to run the web service without any argument.

Use now the -p flag to access the contents with your browser. The output to your browser should be something like: `{ message: "You connected to the following path: ...`

Submit your used commands for this exercise.

using the previously created "web-server"

docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 web-server
